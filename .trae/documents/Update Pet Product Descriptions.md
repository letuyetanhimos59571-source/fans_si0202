I will update the product descriptions for the "Pet" category products based on the search results and standard industry specifications for these items.

1. **Identify Target Products**: I have identified 10 specific pet products in your database (Feeding Mats, Lick Mats, Litter Mats, Bowls, Treat Pouches, etc.).
2. **Construct Specifications**: For each product, I will generate a detailed specification table including:

   * **Material**: Food Grade Silicone (as standard for these products).

   * **Style**: E.g., "Anti-spill", "Slow Feeder", "Portable", "Cute Paw Print".

   * **Specs**: Dimensions (e.g., 40x30cm), colors (Blue/Green/Grey), and features (Suction cups, Folding).

   * **Occasion**: E.g., "Daily Feeding", "Bathing Distraction", "Outdoor Travel", "Training".

   * **Price Range**: Estimated wholesale price ranges (e.g., 5-15 CNY).

   * **Customization/Logo**: "Yes/Available" (Standard for factory goods).
3. **Execute Update**: I will write and run a Python script to update `assets/products.json` with these new details, ensuring all prohibited information (Brand, Platform, etc.) is excluded.
4. **Verify**: I will confirm the update is successful.
