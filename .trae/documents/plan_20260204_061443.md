I will implement a client-side solution to handle the form submission and verification code, as requested.

1.  **Email Submission**: Since this is a static site (HTML/JS), we cannot send emails directly from the server side without a backend service. I will use the `mailto:` protocol as a simple, effective client-side solution. When the user clicks "Submit", the system will open the user's default email client with a pre-filled email to `1753720535@qq.com` containing the formatted form data (Name, Email, Message).
2.  **Verification Code**: I will add a simple JavaScript-based random verification code generator.
    *   Display a random 4-digit code in a `<span>` or `<div>` next to the input.
    *   Validate that the user's input matches this code before allowing the `mailto:` action.
3.  **Form Validation**: Ensure the "Email" field (and others) are strictly validated as required fields before submission.

**Implementation Steps:**
1.  **Modify `contact/index.html`**:
    *   Add a container for displaying the random verification code.
    *   Update the form to use `id="contactForm"` for easy JS selection.
2.  **Update `scripts/main.js`** (or create a specific script for contact):
    *   Add logic to generate a random 4-digit code on page load.
    *   Add an event listener for form submission.
    *   Validate the captcha and required fields.
    *   Construct the `mailto:` URL with `subject` and `body`.
    *   Trigger `window.location.href` to open the email client.

This approach meets all user requirements without needing a complex backend setup.
